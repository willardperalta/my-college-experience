        <h1>Maui Photos with the Canon 80D</h1>
  
        <img src="images/20.jpg" alt="picture of grand wailea sunset">
        <p>Welcome to my photo website! I wanted to practice creating websites with pure HTML and CSS so I decided to showcase some DSLR photos I've taken in Maui. These are a few photos I took back in 2016 on Maui when I wanted to test out my Canon 80D DSLR. I usually use my 80D for video so this was an opportunity for me to practice taking photos!</p>

        </div>

        <p id="grid-description">These photos I took at Kam3 in Kihei. I think it was around 8 or 9 in the morning, so the water was really calm and the skies were a clear blue, making for some nice blue photos. Since the sky was so clear I was able to get a clear shot of the windmills that were all the way across the other side. My favorite shot is of the paddleboarders, it's essentially half sky, and half ocean with two tiny paddleboarders on the right side of the frame showing how big the ocean really is.</p>

        <p id="grid-description">These photos at Wailea Beach seem to be around sunset time, maybe around 5pm or 6pm. These shots were taken near the walkway that's on the left of the Four Seasons if you're facing the beach side. Essentially the back of four seasons. The walkway connects the Four Seasons and Polo Beach.</p>

            <img src="images/17.jpg">
        </div>
        <p id="grid-description">These shots were taken right sunset at Polo Beach which I think is near the Fairmont in Wailea, it's near the Four Seasons too. The third shot in the first row is a photo that I've kept as my computer background for a while now, I just really like how I got to capture the sunlight hitting the ocean!</p>

        <h2>The Grand Wailea</h2>

        <div id="grid-container">
            <img src="images/18.jpg" alt="picture of windmills at kam3 beach">

            <img src="images/21.jpg">
        </div>

        <p id="grid-description">These photos were also taken at sunset. but at the Grand Wailea. I was lucky enough to have the sky turn a nice pink at sunset, and eventually turn blue, making it seem like the sky was almost purple at some point. The third photo is more purple than it actually was at the time, I actually increased the saturation in Adobe Lightroom to bring out the colors of the sky a little more.</p>

        <h2>The Hyatt Kaanapali</h2>

        <div id="grid-container">
            <img src="images/22.jpg" alt="picture of windmills at kam3 beach">

            <img src="images/25.jpg">
        </div>

        <p id="grid-description">These photos taken at the Hyatt in Kaanapali most likely were taken in the afternoon time. My favorite shot is of the swan looking down into the water, it was one of those shots that I didn't plan to take, the Swan just so happened to go up to the water when I was there, so I crouched down to its level and took the photo right there.</p>
